# Single-bit-Floating-Adder
A fast and energy-efficient floating point unit is always needed in electronics industry
especially in DSP, image processing and as arithmetic unit in microprocessors. Many
numerically intensive applications require rapid execution of arithmetic operations. 

The objective is to design a 32 bit single precision floating point
adder/subtractor on the IEEE 754 standard floating point representations.
